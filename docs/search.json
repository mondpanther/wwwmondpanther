I am also associated with Growth Programme at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.\r\nI am the Principal Investigator of the Productive & Inclusive Netzero Project (PRINZ, funded by the ESRC)\r\nAs of the academic year 2023/24 I am seconded to the economic research unit of the International Financial Corporation (Part of the Worldbank) to develop a research programme on climate change and sustainability.\r\nIn my research I focus on things that help to increase economic productivity without compromising the natural environment. I am also concerned about the effects and causes of online mis-information and the re-emergence of bigotism. Some of my other passions include cycling (particularly in London) and windsurfing.\r\nGoogle Scholar Profile | On Twitter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We study the adoption of such a technology by building a virtual power plant.\r\nPowbal\r\nDesign and evaluation of Industrial Policy\r\nIndustrial policy in the form of targeted support for specific sectors or technologies enjoys a renaissance. But which sectors exactly should be supported? I argue that governments should identify existing market failures and use industrial policy to correct these if no other tools are available. The most obvious market failure relevant to this are differences in knowledge spillovers from different technologies. I develop the idea over a number of different reports and papers including:\r\nSustainable growth in the UK\r\nSome Causal Effects of an Industrial Policy\r\nEvaluation of Climate Change Policy\r\nDoes climate policy do what it says on the tin?\r\nThe impact of a carbon tax on manufacturing\r\nIndustry Compensation under Relocation Risk: A Firm-Level Analysis of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme\r\nWhat determines the direction of innovation?\r\nInnovation is the key driver of economic growth. However, not all technologies generate the same externalities. Therefore it is important to know the flavour of innovation in addition to the quantity.\r\nEnvironmental Preferences and Technological Choices: Is Market Competition Clean or Dirty?\r\nCarbon Taxes, Path Dependency, and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Auto Industry\r\nThe causes and consequence of online mis-information\r\nThere is no doubt much dis-information on social media. However, does this make any difference for tangible and relevant outcomes such as who wins elections or who gets infected in a pandemic?\r\nInfections of the body and the mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
