I am also concerned about the effects and causes of online mis-information and the re-emergence of bigotism. Some of my other passions include cycling (particularly in London) and windsurfing.\r\nGoogle Scholar Profile | On Twitter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The Figure below shows the\r\ndistribution of maximum power connected across plugs. This average at\r\n1125 Watt. Note that the distribution is bimodal. There is a\r\nconcentration of users at below 1kWh. However, there is also a fairly\r\nbig mass above 2kWh. Users in that range must have connected a fairly\r\nsubstantial air-conditioning unit or similar.\r\nMean power consumption is naturally much lower and highly\r\nconcentrated near 0. That said: for some users even the unconditional\r\naverage is above 1kW; i.e. they are connecting an air conditioning unit\r\nor similar in most periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic time series - A bird’s eye view on the whole pilot\r\ntrial…..\r\n\r\nPlugs Connected:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnergy consumed (Wh):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHours of the day\r\nAverage figures by hour of the day. This gives us an idea if users\r\nare providing more shifting potential by the hour of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of switch off events…..\r\nThe figure below shows the distribution of power consumed as a switch\r\noff event progresses.\r\n\r\nWe see that most switch off events are successful; i.e. users\r\ntypically do not override. This is based on 1368 events across all users\r\nwith non zero consumption at the start of the event. In total we had\r\n8480 switch off events across online plugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual power plant capacity factors\r\nBelow we compute the capacity factor of our implicit virtual power\r\nplant; i.e. across all switch off events we calculate - by switch off\r\nduration - what fraction of potential implied power generation has been\r\nrealised. We see that this amounts to over 80% for the whole duraction\r\nof our 30 minute switch offs (note that the data is discretized at the\r\nlevel of 5 minute intervals)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We study the adoption of such a technology by building a virtual power plant.\r\nPowbal\r\nDesign and evaluation of Industrial Policy\r\nIndustrial policy in the form of targeted support for specific sectors or technologies enjoys a renaissance. But which sectors exactly should be supported? I argue that governments should identify existing market failures and use industrial policy to correct these if no other tools are available. The most obvious market failure relevant to this are differences in knowledge spillovers from different technologies. I develop the idea over a number of different reports and papers including:\r\nSustainable growth in the UK\r\nSome Causal Effects of an Industrial Policy\r\nEvaluation of Climate Change Policy\r\nDoes climate policy do what it says on the tin?\r\nThe impact of a carbon tax on manufacturing\r\nIndustry Compensation under Relocation Risk: A Firm-Level Analysis of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme\r\nWhat determines the direction of innovation?\r\nInnovation is the key driver of economic growth. However, not all technologies generate the same externalities. Therefore it is important to know the flavour of innovation in addition to the quantity.\r\nEnvironmental Preferences and Technological Choices: Is Market Competition Clean or Dirty?\r\nCarbon Taxes, Path Dependency, and Directed Technical Change: Evidence from the Auto Industry\r\nThe causes and consequence of online mis-information\r\nThere is no doubt much dis-information on social media. However, does this make any difference for tangible and relevant outcomes such as who wins elections or who gets infected in a pandemic?\r\nInfections of the body and the mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
